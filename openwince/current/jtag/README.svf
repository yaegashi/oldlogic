SVF Player for JTAG Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This README describes the SVF player of the JTAG Tools software package.

The player has been developed according to the "Serial Vector Format
Specification", Revision E, 8 March 1999 issued by ASSET InterTech, Inc. The
full specification can be found at

  http://www.asset-intertech.com/support/svf.pdf

Please read the file COPYING for more info.


Usage
-----

The SVF player operates on a single part in the scan chain. Therefore, you
have to bring up the JTAG Tools software, specify a cable and detect the scan
chain beforehand.

The player will establish a new instruction called "SIR" and a new register
called "SDR". They are used internally by the respective SVF commands and are
reassigned with new values as the player advances through the file. It is not
recommended to use them outside of the SVF player as their content is dynamic.


Example session:

jtag> cable ppdev /dev/parport0 DLC5
Initializing Xilinx DLC5 JTAG Parallel Cable III on ppdev port /dev/parport0

jtag> detect
IR length: 5
Chain length: 1
Device Id: 10010000101000100000000010010011
  Manufacturer: Xilinx
  Part:         XC2S300E-PQ208
  Stepping:     9
  Filename:     /usr/local/share/jtag/xilinx/xc2s300e-pq208/xc2s300e-pq208

jtag> part <desired part of the scan chain>

jtag> svf <SVF file for selected part>

jtag> instruction BYPASS

jtag> part <next part>

jtag> svf <SVF file for selected part>

jtag> instruction BYPASS

...


It is recommended to set the part's instruction register to BYPASS although
most SVF files do this at the end. By setting the instruction explicitely to
BYPASS the output of the print command will always show meaningful
information.

The SVF player will issue messages when situations arise that cannot be
handled. These messages are classified as warnings or errors depending on
whether the player can continue operation (warning) or not (error).

In case the TDO parameter of an SDR command leads to a mismatch the player
issues a warning and continues. If the player should abort in this case then
specify 'stop' at the svf command.


Limitations and Deficiencies
----------------------------

Several limitations exist for the SVF player.

It has been tested with files generated by these tools so far:
  + Xilinx ISE WebPack 6.3.02i
  + Altera Quartus II 4.1sp1

Configuration for these devices has been tested so far:
  + Xilinx Spartan-IIE, XC2S300E-PQ208
  + Altera MAX3032, EPM3032ALC44
  + Altera MAX3064, EPM3064ALC44

The player has not been tested with scan chains containing more than one part.

The implementation of some SVF commands has deficiencies.
  - HIR, HDR
    Commands not supported.
    Their functionality should be covered by the part concept of JTAG Tools.

  - PIO
    Command not supported.

  - PIOMAP
    Command not supported.

  - RUNTEST
    SCK not supported.
    The maximum time constraint is not guaranteed.

  - SIR
    Parameter SMASK is not considered.
    No check is done against the TDO parameter.

  - SDR
    Parameter SMASK is not considered.

  - TRST
    Parameters Z and ABSENT are not supported.

  - TIR, TDR
    Commands not supported.
    Their functionality should be covered by the part concept of JTAG Tools.

Warning and error messages don't mention the line in the SVF file where the
issue was detected.

Operation is slowed down significantly when the FREQUENCY command has been
specified.
This is not a problem of the SVF player itself but seem to happen when the
frequency of JTAG Tools is set to a value larger than 0. Configuration takes
very long although the maximum allowed frequency is 10 MHz.
Consider to comment out the FREQUENCY command at the beginning of the SVF
file.
