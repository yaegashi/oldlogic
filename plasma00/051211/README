* Spartan-3 Plasma Kit

Spartan-3 Plasma Kit is an application of the Plasma CPU core (MIPS I
compatible) on the Spartan-3 Starter Kit from XILINX.  Not only being a working
CPU core, it also includes I/O interfaces for the peripheral devices on the
board like SRAM, RS-232C and VGA, aiming to be a practical platform for the
hobby programming.

mlite directory contains the cpu core files imported from the Plasma project.
All other descriptions like the top level, peripheral I/O, test benches for the
simulator are in the top directory.

gdb-stub directory contains the firmware.  Most codes are stolen from the MIPS
Linux kernel.  It has many lacking features for real debugging, as the CPU is
quite immature yet.

loadelf directory contains a sample application.  You could see a GIF image
displayed from the VGA port by running "make b2con" there.

* Memory map

0x00000000: Start of the SRAM memory and the entry point.
0x000c0000: Framebuffer 640x480x3bpp in the packed pixel format.
            Each byte contains 2 pixels.
0x00100000: End of the SRAM memory.
0x40000000: Serial I/O data register (read/write)
0x40000004: Serial I/O status register (read)
            bit 0: TXEMPTY (transmit buffer is empty)
	    bit 1: RXREADY (one character is received)
	    bit 2: RXFERROR (last received character contains a framing error)
	    bit 3: RXOERROR (overflow error occured)

* TODO

  Hardware
    - Improve speed and size more by utilizing dedicated functions in the
      Spartan-3 FPGA, like block RAMs and multipliers.
    - Implement exception and interrupt features which conforms to common MIPS
      specifications.
  Software:
    - Improve GDB stub.
    - Port a kernel like eCos, uCLinux.
